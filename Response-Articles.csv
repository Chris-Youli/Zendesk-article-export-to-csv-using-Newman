The easiest way to do this is to have the person log in and then change their email on that account to some other email. </p><p>For example, if I am a Co-Planner with my <a href=""mailto:claire@youli.team"">claire@youli.team</a> email address, I would log into YouLi with that address and then go into my ACCOUNT and change that email address to a <em>different </em>email address (perhaps my personal email).</p><p><img src=""https://help.youli.io/hc/article_attachments/4641904577295/Screen_Shot_2022-04-08_at_5.14.29_PM.png"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2022-04-08_at_5.14.29_PM.png""><br><br>2.

It is similar to having the option when purchasing a flight to make it refundable under certain conditions. This is in addition to any travel insurance the traveler may purchase.</span></li><li class=""ql-indent-1""><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">Once the travel starts, Refund Protect refund application can no longer be made. </span></li><li class=""ql-indent-1""><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">Some travel insurance also provides pre-trip cancellation coverage. Still, your traveler should check the terms for Refund Protect to compare to their intended travel insurance product to see whether they need one or both products.

According to this Act, it’s not a must for a contract to consist of a written signature. For an agreement to be valid, all it takes is for all parties to agree mutually and understand the contract thoroughly. Hence a typed signature constitutes as proof that all parties involved have agreed to the terms.</p><p>In the EU, typed signatures became accepted as legally binding through a <a title=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?qid=1440760419726&amp;uri=celex:31999l0093"" href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1440760419726&amp;uri=CELEX:31999L0093"">community framework</a> directive for electronic signature.

Review their response and choose to accept or deny them. If you accept them: Add them to the other trip (which you've copied &amp; made private) and send them a message to pay their deposit on the private trip.

So it can be things like:<ul><li>""10% base and 5% bonus when hitting targets""</li></ul></li><li>The Commission Rate is used to calculate commission accrued.<ul><li>Each Affiliate can be assigned a different commission rate</li><li>This number is treated as a percentage and applied to the BASE package or personalized price for the booked traveler</li><li>Set this number to 0 and leave a commission note if you are just tracking leads (not paying commission on booking)</li></ul></li><li>Internal notes are like Planner notes - but only the Team can see them, not the Affiliate</li><li>The Invitation Note is sent in the invitation email that your affiliate will receive so that they can create their account and start selling your trips! <ul><li>Make it friendly!</li></ul></li></ol><h2>How to see my referrals?</h2><ol><li>Click to your DASHBOARD</li><li>Click the REPORTS tab</li><li>Click AFFILIATE REFERRALS</li></ol><h2><img src=""https://help.youli.io/hc/article_attachments/4407828779535/Screen_Shot_2021-10-13_at_9.42.30_am.png"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2021-10-13_at_9.42.30_am.png""></h2><p>You will see a list of all referrals from invited Affiliates. </p><p>Your Affiliate will see ONLY their referrals in this same report.</p><p> </p><h2>Manage Commission and Lead Generation Payments</h2><p>Your Affiliate agreement will determine when + how you pay for your referrals. YouLi reporting provides you a convenient way to track this but DOES NOT make the payments for you.</p><p><em>TIP: Scroll to the right to see whether the tasks have been completed for those bookings in case you require profile information to be completed by your affiliate to earn a commission.</em></p><p>Here's an example of an Affiliate Referrals report. It includes a number of different cases:</p><ol><li>AFFILIATE 2 is only being paid for leads</li><li>CLAIRE STAGING AFFILIATE has accrued $450 in commission but it won't be paid until after the DATE TRIP ENDS (24 JUL 2022)</li><li>There is a CANCELLED booking, so no commission is accrued</li><li>There are two NOT BOOKED referrals, which you or your Affiliates could be working to convert</li></ol><p> </p><p><img src=""https://help.youli.io/hc/article_attachments/4407828789135/Screen_Shot_2021-10-13_at_9.47.46_am.png"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2021-10-13_at_9.47.46_am.png""></p><p> </p><h2>How is Your Affiliate Commission Calculated? </h2><p>Affiliate commissions are ONLY calculated based on the base package prices or personalized prices. This means your affiliates will NOT receive any commission from additional itinerary items you allow your travels to add onto their trip. Affiliate commissions will also not account for any taxes or fees that your travelers may be required to pay. </p><p> </p><h2>Creating Affiliate Agreements for Success</h2><p>If you don't already have your affiliates' agreements in place, you'll want to take the time to get that right, watch our Masterclass to learn how to set up your program for success.

When you turn your Zap on, it will run the action steps every time the trigger event occurs. A trigger is an event that starts a Zap.</p><p>A trigger for example, could be a traveler entering their email onto one of your YouLi Trip Pages. The Zap would then be that email entered into YouLi being sent to your CRM. </p><h3> </h3><h3><font color=""#000000"">Send Registrations From YouLi to Your CRM</font></h3><p>Connect YouLi to your CRM or Email Service Provider.

This is for security purposes to ensure their private information is not disclosed to the wrong person. Previously the alert telling them to check their email was using YouLi branding instead of YOUR branding. Oops!

It doesn’t usually happen, but you might be using YouLi in “brochure-mode” in which case you might just want to send interest to your operator. In that case, you can add them to the trip, list them as a contact and unlist yourself as a contact.

If you get enough registrations, you can convert to Set Departure and all your Itinerary dates will be set automatically. </li></ol><h3>&gt; Trip Pages are not just for marketing, they are also for post-booking</h3><p>Most websites and landing pages are only useful to entice the initial registration. Then you need to start sending out all the pre-trip information and gathering all the information back from your Travelers.</p><p>Your Trip Page is the hub that your Travelers keep going back to.

Once they click APPLY, it will appear on their invoice, <em>but it will not be permanently applied unless they pay at least one installment.</em></p><p>4. Once paid, they will see the discount applied on their invoice and you'll get a confirmation email of the payment.</p><p>5. The COUPON discount is applied to the total, not to the deposit amount, so <strong>the full deposit will be charged</strong> when the coupon is redeemed. Additionally, the amount for all other visible installments, following the deposit, will not reflect the coupon discount, instead, it will be applied to their FINAL installment, the <em>balance</em>. But don't worry! While their <em>balance </em>isn’t visible to them, your traveler will accurately see what they owe, minus the coupon under ""Amount Owing"" on their invoice.</p><h2>Restrictions</h2><p>Because this is a new feature, it does has a few limitations:</p><ul><li>Only one coupon per booking - so even if <a href=""https://help.youli.io/hc/en-us/articles/360001093155"" target=""_self"">more than one person registers</a>, they will only get the coupon applied once. They will need to book separately to use multiple coupons, or you can create a special ""couples offer"" coupon.</li><li>The discount is a fixed amount, not a percentage</li><li>The coupon CANNOT be removed once a payment is made</li><li>Coupons can only be added to individual trips. Contact YouLi support if you would like to add a coupon to work across all your trips </li></ul>"

When looking at the samples in this document, anything that is personal information or trip specific will be replaced. We recommend adding yourself to the trip and go through all the cases to see what your messages will look like.</p><h1>How many reminders are sent?</h1><p>We only send one email reminder per 24 hour period.
